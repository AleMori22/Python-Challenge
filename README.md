# Python-Challenge

The PyPoll and PyBank folders each holds one Analysis, one Resources folder and a python script saved as main.py. The main.py script runs the .csv file located in the relative Resources folder and outputs the results in the assigned Analysis folder as .txt file.

All the code is made by me with the help of the class material and by consulting the resources.
